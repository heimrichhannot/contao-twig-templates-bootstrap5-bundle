# Bootstrap 5 for Twig Template Bundles

This bundle brings support for the Bootstrap 5 Framework to [Contao Twig Templates Bundle](https://github.com/heimrichhannot/contao-twig-templates-bundle).

Please be aware that this bundle only brings bootstrap 5 compatible templates. The framework assets are not part of this bundle. We recommend using our [Encore Bundle](https://github.com/heimrichhannot/contao-encore-bundle) for assets management with contao.

## Setup

Install: `composer require heimrichhannot/contao-twig-templates-bootstrap5-bundle`

In your page layout, check "Use Twig Template" and select bootstrap 5 as framework. Done.
